    const recipeQuestions = [
        { question: 'How do I know when my recipe is fully cooked?', answer: 'Cooking times vary depending on the type of recipe and the ingredients used. For most dishes, follow the recipe\'s suggested cooking time and use a thermometer to ensure meats reach a safe internal temperature. You can also look for visual cues, such as browning or thickening, as indicators.' },
        { question: 'Can I substitute ingredients if I don\'t have everything listed in the recipe?', answer: 'Yes! Many ingredients have substitutes that can work well. For instance, if you\'re out of buttermilk, you can mix milk with a little lemon juice. Just keep in mind that substitutions might alter the flavor or texture slightly.' },
        { question: 'How do I prevent my food from sticking to the pan?', answer: 'To prevent sticking, ensure your pan is preheated before adding oil or butter. Use a non-stick pan if available, and avoid overcrowding the pan. Adding food to a cold pan or cooking with too little oil can lead to sticking.' },
        { question: 'What are some tips for meal prepping?', answer: 'Start by choosing recipes that store well, like soups, stews, and salads. Invest in good-quality containers, label each meal with the date, and refrigerate or freeze as needed. Dedicate a specific day to meal prep to save time during the week.' },
        { question: 'How can I make my dish more flavorful?', answer: 'Seasoning at different stages can enhance flavor. Use fresh herbs and spices, marinate meats, and taste as you cook. Adding a bit of acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, at the end can also brighten the flavors in your dish.' }
